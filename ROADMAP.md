# codebuddy Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction and planned features for codebuddy.

## Vision

Make codebuddy the go-to MCP server for Language Server Protocol integration, enabling AI assistants to understand and navigate codebases as effectively as human developers.

- ‚úÖ TypeScript/JavaScript support out of the box
- ‚úÖ Smart CLI with auto-detection (`init`, `status`, `fix`, `config`, `logs`)
- ‚úÖ Auto-installation of missing language servers
- ‚úÖ Real-time server availability checking
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Short-term Goals (Next 3 months)

### v1.1 - Enhanced Language Support  
- ‚úÖ Auto-detection of installed language servers (`codebuddy init`)
- ‚úÖ Built-in configurations for 15+ programming languages
- [ ] Language-specific initialization options
- ‚úÖ Better error messages for missing language servers

### v1.2 - Performance Improvements
