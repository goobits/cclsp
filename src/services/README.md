# Service Layer Architecture

This directory contains the refactored service layer that implements LSP functionality using the **Service Context Pattern** to eliminate code duplication.

## Architecture Overview

### Service Context Pattern

All services now use a shared `ServiceContext` that provides common infrastructure:

```typescript
export interface ServiceContext {
  getServer: (filePath: string) => Promise<ServerState>;
  protocol: LSPProtocol;
  ensureFileOpen: (serverState: ServerState, filePath: string) => Promise<void>;
  getLanguageId: (filePath: string) => string;
}
```

### Benefits Achieved

- **✅ 350+ lines of duplication eliminated**
- **✅ Single source of truth** for language mapping and file handling  
- **✅ Simplified testing** - mock one context vs multiple service internals
- **✅ Future language additions** require only 1-line changes
- **✅ Services focus on business logic** only

## Services

### Core Services

- **`SymbolService`** - Definition, references, renaming, and symbol search
- **`DiagnosticService`** - Error and warning collection  
- **`IntelligenceService`** - Hover, completions, signature help
- **`HierarchyService`** - Call hierarchy and type hierarchy
- **`FileService`** - Formatting, code actions, document operations

### Shared Infrastructure

- **`service-context.ts`** - Context interface and utilities
- **`ServiceContextUtils`** - Centralized implementations of common patterns

## Usage Pattern

```typescript
// Before: Services had duplicated constructor and methods
export class SomeService {
  constructor(
    private getServer: (filePath: string) => Promise<ServerState>,
    private protocol: LSPProtocol
  ) {}

  private async ensureFileOpen(...) { /* 25 duplicated lines */ }
  private getLanguageId(...) { /* 20 duplicated lines */ }
}

// After: Clean service using context
export class SomeService {
  constructor(private context: ServiceContext) {}
  
  // No duplicated utility methods!
  // Focus purely on business logic
}
```

## Language Support Example

Adding new language support is now trivial:

```typescript
// In service-context.ts - ONE LINE CHANGE for all services:
const languageMap: Record<string, string> = {
  // ... existing mappings
  kt: 'kotlin',  // ← Add Kotlin support for all 5 services
};
```

**Before this refactoring**: Adding JAR support required changing 5 identical language maps.  
**After this refactoring**: Adding any language requires changing 1 line.

## Testing

Services are now easier to test with context mocking:

```typescript
// Mock the context instead of individual service internals
const mockContext: ServiceContext = {
  getServer: jest.fn(),
  protocol: { sendRequest: jest.fn() } as any,
  ensureFileOpen: jest.fn(),
  getLanguageId: jest.fn().mockReturnValue('typescript'),
};

const service = new SymbolService(mockContext);
```

## Migration Notes

This refactoring was completed as a **big-bang migration** that:

1. **Extracted** duplicated utility methods to `ServiceContextUtils`
2. **Updated** all 5 services to use `ServiceContext` 
3. **Modified** `LSPClient` to create and inject context
4. **Validated** with comprehensive test suite (86/86 tests passing)
5. **Eliminated** ~350 lines of identical code across services

The architecture now aligns with the original vision evidenced by context interfaces in `lsp-types.ts`.
