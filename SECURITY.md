## Security Considerations

### Language Server Protocol (LSP) Servers

cclsp spawns external LSP server processes based on configuration. Users should:

1. **Trust your LSP servers**: Only use LSP servers from trusted sources
2. **Review configurations**: Carefully review any shared `cclsp.json` configurations
3. **Use official servers**: Prefer official language servers when available

### Configuration Security

- Never include sensitive information in `cclsp.json`
- Be cautious with configurations that execute arbitrary commands
- Review command arguments carefully

### MCP Protocol Security

cclsp follows MCP protocol security best practices:
- No arbitrary code execution without explicit configuration
- Clear boundaries between tool capabilities
- Transparent operation logging

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep cclsp updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Audit configurations**: Review `cclsp.json` before using
3. **Use trusted sources**: Only install language servers from official sources
4. **Report issues**: If something seems wrong, report it immediately
